Neural encoding with auditory masking


auditory maskikng is an psychoacoustic phenomenon that some components of the signals are inaudible, in both frequency and time doamin.

In frequency domain, it is called simultaneous masking, or inter-band masking. Usually two kinds of simultaneous maskings are considiered. 
1) absolute hearing threshold: our auditory system are sensitive to different freuqncy bands with different response thresholds, below which the audio intensites are unperceptable. 
2) a masker signal (a dominant signal in frequency domain) will mask the other signals that are close to it in the frequency domain. 

In time domain, it is called temporal masking.
